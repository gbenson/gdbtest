diffsum-20200227-all lists 1736 tests

of those:

  1069 tests improved to IDENTICAL
     4 BOMBED tests improved to SKIPPED

    11 skipped tests partially improved to REGRESEED
    16 equivalent tests evaluated to !IDENTICAL

     5 tests regressed from IDENTICAL

   615 tests are unchanged
     5 tests flipped IMPROVED <=> REGRESSED (i.e. unchanged)

    15 tests vanished from upstream
   120 tests appeared from upstream, of which
          91 are identical/equivalent
      and 29 need attention

[1736 - 15 + 120 = 1841, but diffsum-20201117-all lists 1845,
so I made an error somewhere]

@1047:
   not IDENTICAL = 1845-1645 = 200 testcases
   5 weeks = 25 days
   200 testcases in 25 days = 8 testcases/day

   20201117 - 20200227 = 274 days ~= 196 working days total,
   (i.e. assuming no PTO or absence, and no days spent doing
   other work)

   1068 improvements / 8 testcases/day = 134 days
